	<h1>2.1 View All Subjects Help</h1>
	<p>This section allows you to view all the subjects that are enrolled in your current study. You can choose to reorder the list of subjects by clicking on a column title. The ascending or descending arrow located next to the column header indicates the sorting.</p>
	<p>In the top of the table you can use the <em>green arrows</em> to navigate through the pages. If you have less than 15 subjects in your study the arrows are greyed out, which means that there is only one page to display.<br />
	With the <em>drop-down menu</em> next to the arrows you can choose how many subjects should be displayed on one page (15, 25, or 50).</p>
	<p>With the <em><b>Show More</b></em> link you can expand the subject matrix to include additional columns containing Subject Status, OID, Sex, Secondary Label and Group Assignment:</p>
	<table>
      <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>Subject Status:</b></td>
        <td>This cell indicates the Subject Status. It could be available, signed, removed, or auto-removed.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>OID:</b></td>
        <td>OIDs are a system generated identifier which are used for the importing of data, creation of rules and in CDISC ODM exporting of data.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
	  <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>Sex:</b></td>
        <td>This cell indicates the sex of each subject.  Note that it might be a different text, set in the Study Parameters section.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
	  <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>Secondary Label:</b></td>
        <td>This cell indicates the Secondary Label of each subject.  Note that it might be a different text, set in the Study Parameters section.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
	  	  <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>Group Assignment:</b></td>
        <td>A Subject Group Class is a class of group categories that are related and mutually exclusive. Once Subject Group Classes have been created, subjects may be assigned to one of the groups. The group class to which a subject has been assigned will be displayed in this column.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
	<p>To collapse the table click the <em><b>Hide</b></em> link, you will see instead of the <em><b>Show More</b></em> link, in the top of the table if it is expanded.</p>
	<p>With the drop-down menu, <em><b>Select An Event</b></em> in the top of the subject list, you can filter the subjects by an event. You can also filter by entering free text or by selecting a pre-defined choice from the drop-down menu, in the grey boxes underneath each column title. To apply the filter select the <em><b>Apply Filter</b></em> link.<br />
	To reset the filter click on the <em><b>Clear Filter</b></em> link next to it.</p>
	<p>The subject matrix provides you with the following columns by default:</p>
	<table>
      <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>1. Study Subject ID</b></td>
        <td>This cell provides you with the Study Subject ID of each individual subject.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="left"><b>2. Study Events</b></td>
        <td >For each subject, you will see the Study Events with their status icon and next to it the number of occurrences if it is a Repeating Event. 
        If you click of one of these icons you can schedule the event, view or enter data as well as edit or remove the event from the subject.  You can also 
        see Discrepancy Notes for the Subject, Event, or individual CRF.<p></p></td>
      </tr>
